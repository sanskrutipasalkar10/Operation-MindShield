Project Title:
Operation MindShield: AI-Powered PTSD Risk Prediction, Automated Alerts & Dashboard for Soldier Well-being

Overview:
"Operation MindShield" is an end-to-end data science and automation project that leverages machine learning to predict PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) risk levels among soldiers. The system incorporates data preprocessing, risk prediction, real-time alerting, and dashboard visualization to support mental health intervention in military settings.

Objectives:
Predict PTSD risk levels (Low / Medium / High) using supervised learning.

Automate email alerts for soldiers at high risk.

Visualize trends, KPIs, and risk distribution in an interactive dashboard.

Schedule model execution using Windows Task Scheduler for real-time monitoring.

Prepare professional, clean data pipeline using Power Query.

Tech Stack:
Jupyter Notebook (EDA, preprocessing, ML model)

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Excel + Power Query (data cleaning and formatting)

Power BI (dashboard visualizations)

Windows Task Scheduler (automation)

SMTP (automated email alerts)

Key Features:
Cleaned and prepared raw military health data using Power Query.

Performed detailed EDA and trained multiple classifiers to predict PTSD risk.

Implemented automation to monitor data and send alerts when high-risk soldiers are detected.

Built a Power BI dashboard to analyze trends, support system strength, alcohol patterns, and stress levels.

Emphasized explainability using feature importance plots.
